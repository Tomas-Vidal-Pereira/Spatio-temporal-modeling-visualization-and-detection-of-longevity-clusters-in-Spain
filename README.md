This repository contains the full R code that I used for computing and visualizing the location index of the centenarian population (by municipalities and provinces) and the sex ratio (by municipalities and provinces) in Spain.
In addition, it contains a clusterization algorithm that uses three different metrics: spatial, temporal and longevity metrics. The longevity metric is the one I created combined the two indices previously mentioned.
The code ends with the visualization of the longevity clusters.
